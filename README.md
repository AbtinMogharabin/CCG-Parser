# CCG Semantic Parser by the Internal Merge

This repository contains my implementation of a CCG-based semantic parser in Python. In this project, I implemented some of the interesting topics I learned in COGS543 (Computational Semantics) and COGS532 (Computational Morphology and Syntax) graduate courses.

The current version is almost done with the general implementation, but the code is still not in suitable working condition. I'm still actively updating the details (especially the details regarding [CCG](https://direct.mit.edu/ling/article-abstract/doi/10.1162/ling_a_00521/117700/On-Internal-Merge?redirectedFrom=fulltext)).
